	<h3 class="w3-center"><u><b>About</b></u></h3>
	<p class="w3-center">Hey there! <b>Hoson</b>'s the name and <b>programmings</b> my game. </p>
	<p> I am a student studying at the 
	<b><a href="https://aie.edu.au/" target="_blank">Academy of Interactive Entertainment</a>, Melbourne, Australia</b>.
	The course that I am currently undertaking is the Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development,
	but by the time you are reading this I should've already graduated. Well I hope I did.</br>
	</br>Basically, through this folio I am aiming to get a job. Which would in turn grant me a foothold in the industry,
	allowing me to grow in both as a person and a programmer. 
	Ultimately, I aim to one day be able to write code that meets industry standards and more.</br></p>
	<h3 class="w3-center"><u><b>Skills</b></u></h3>
	<h5><b>Scripting Languages</b></h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>C++</b>, The majority of my works during the Advanced Diploma were scripted in C++. 
		I have utilised code libraries such as the ones from the AIE Bootstrap and have also created a simple one myself. 
		Overall, I feel that I am decently knowledged in C++ coding.</li>
		<li><b>C#</b>, Due to it being Unity's main scripting language and the similarities with C++, 
		I am as proficient in C# as I am in C++.</li>
		<!-- <li><b>Lua</b>, I have dabbled in Lua scripting due to one of my course assignments.  -->
		<!-- However, I only know the basics. But, if the need arises I will challenge myself to learn the language,  -->
		<!-- or any other programming language for that matter.</li> -->
	</ul>
	<h5><b>Software</b></h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Visual Studio</b>, Most programmers' weapon of choice.</li>
		<li><b>GitHub</b>, Source control is our best friend.</li>
		<li><b>Unity</b>, All the projects scripted in C# were created with Unity. 
		I have an average enough grasp on Unity and its many components.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>This application was made to create and edit custom 2D navmeshes for a first year Advanced Diploma assignment. 
	I actually spent more time working on the tool than the actual assignment!</br>
	The program can load in an image to base the navmesh on. It saves/loads its created navmeshes by utilising XML.</p>

    <p>SSR was one of my first games created during the Advanced Diploma. 
	Made during the first year after gaining enough knowledge to do so.
	Basically, "bullet hell boss fight game" sums it all up. 
	Being incredibly hard, very few players have managed to beat: THE ROCK, no cheats legit.</p>

    <p>NSSC was made while studying about quaternions during the first year of the Advanced Diploma.
	Being a later first year project, its code was much more organised than my earlier works. </br>
