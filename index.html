	<h3 class="w3-center"><b>About</b></h3>
	<p class="w3-center">Hey there! <b>Hoson</b>'s the name and <b>programmings</b> my game. </p>
	<p> I am a student studying at the 
	<b><a href="https://aie.edu.au/" target="_blank">Academy of Interactive Etertainment</a>, Melbourne, Australia</b>.
	The course that I am currently undertaking is the Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development,
	but by the time you are reading this I should've already graduated. Well I hope I did.</br>
	</br>Basically, through this folio I am aiming to get a job. Which would in turn grant me a foothold in the industry,
	allowing me to grow in both as a person and a programmer. 
	Ultimately, I aim to one day be able to write code that meets industry standards and more.</br></p>
	<h3 class="w3-center"><b>Skills</b></h3>
	<h5><b>Scripting Languages</b></h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>C++</b>, The majority of my works were scripted in C++, some were also built on top of the AIE Bootstrap. 
		Overall, I feel that I am decently knowledged in C++ coding</li>
		<li><b>C#</b>, Due to it being Unity's main scripting language and the similarities with C++, 
		I am as proficient in C# as I am in C++</li>
		<li><b>Lua</b>, I haved dabbled in Lua scripting due to one of my course assignments. 
		However, I only know the basics. But, if the need arises I will challenge myself to learn the language, 
		or any other programming language for that matter.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5><b>Software</b></h5>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Visual Studio</b>, Most programmers' weapon of choice</li>
		<li><b>GitHub</b>, Source control is our best friend</li>
		<li><b>Unity</b>, All the projects in C# were created with Unity. 
		I have an average enough grasp on Unity and its many components</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="w3-center"><b>Projects</b></h3>
	<p>Throughout my time studying at AIE, there were a number of projects that were either created solely by me or 
	was a group project that I had helped program. Most of them are showcased below. I hope you find my works interesting!</p>
